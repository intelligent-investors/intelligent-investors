Learn the difference between discrete and continuous probability distributions. The binomial and normal distributions are the most important here. You must learn the properties of both distributions and memorize the formulas for the probability of a particular value when given a binomial probability distribution. Learn what shortfall risk is and how to calculate and use Roy\u2019s safety-first criterion. Know how to standardize a normally distributed random variable, use a z-table, and construct confidence intervals. These skills will be used repeatedly in the topic reviews that follow. Additionally, understand the basic features of the lognormal distribution, Monte Carlo simulation, and historical simulation. Finally, it would be a good idea to know how to get continuously compounded rates of return from holding period returns."},"cfa/hypothesis-testing":{"id":"cfa/hypothesis-testing","title":"Hypothesis Testing","description":""},"cfa/index":{"id":"cfa/index","title":"CFA Level 1","description":"Volume 1.

Random variables, events, outcomes, conditional probability, and joint probability are described. Probability rules such as the addition rule and multiplication rule are introduced. These rules are frequently used by finance practitioners. Expected value, standard deviation, covariance, and correlation for individual asset and portfolio returns are discussed.

It is essential that you know the central limit theorem, for it allows us to use sampling statistics to construct confidence intervals for point estimates of population means. Make sure you can calculate confidence intervals for population means given sample parameter estimates and a level of significance, and know when it is appropriate to use the $z$-statistic versus the $t$-statistic. You should also understand the basic procedures for creating random samples, and recognize the warning signs of various sampling biases from nonrandom samples."},"cfa/statistical-concepts-and-market-returns":{"id":"cfa/statistical-concepts-and-market-returns","title":"Statistical Concepts and Market Returns","description":"1.
