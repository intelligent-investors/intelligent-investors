# Time Value Of Money

## A. Interpret interest rates as required rates of return, discount rates, or opportunity costs

Interest rates are our measure of the **time value of money**, although risk differences in financial securities lead to differences in their equilibrium interest rates. Equilibrium interest rates are the required rate of return for a particular investment, in the sense that the market rate of return is the return that investors and savers require to get them to willingly lend their funds.

Interest rates are also referred to a **discount rates** and, in fact, the terms are often used interchangeably. If an individual can borrow funds at an interest rate of 10%, then that individual should discount payments to be made in the future at that rate in order to get their equivalent value in current dollars or other currency.

Finally, we can also view interest rates as the **opportunity cost** of current consumption. If the market rate of interest on one-year securities is 5%, earning an additional 5% is the opportunity forgone when current consumption is chosen rather than saving (postponing consumption).

## B. Explain an interest rate as the sum of a real risk-free rate, expected inflation, and premiums that compensate investors for distinct types of risk.

The **real risk-free rate** of interest is a theoretical rate on a single period loan that has no expectation of inflation in it. When we speak of a real rate of return, we are referring to an investor’s increase in purchasing power (after adjusting for inflation). Since expected inflation in future periods is not zero, the rates we observe on U.S. Treasury bills (T-bills), for example, are risk-free rates but not real rates of return. T-bill rates are **nominal risk-free rates** because they contain an **inflation premium**. The approximate relation here is:

$$
\text{nominal risk-free rate} = \text{real risk-free rate} + \text{expected inflation rate}
$$


Securities may have one or more **types of risk**, and each added risk increases the required rate of return on the security. These types of risk are:

- **Default risk**. The risk that a borrower will not make the promised payments in a timely manner.
- **Liquidity risk**. The risk of receiving less than fair value for an investment if it must be sold for cash quickly.
- **Maturity risk**. As we will cover in detail in the section on debt securities, the prices of longer-term bonds are more volatile than those of shorter-term bonds. Longer maturity bonds have more maturity risk than shorter-term bonds and require a maturity risk premium.

Each of these risk factors is associated with a **risk premium** that we add to the nominal risk-free rate to adjust for greater default risk, less liquidity, and longer maturity relative to a very liquid, short-term, default risk-free rate such as that on T-bills. We can write:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{required interest rate on a security} &= \text{nominal risk-free rate} \\
  &+ \text{default risk premium} \\
  &+ \text{liquidity premium} \\
  &+ \text{maturity risk premium}
\end{align*}
$$

## C. Calculate and interpret the effective annual rate, given the stated annual interest rate and the frequency of compounding, and solve time value of money problems when compounding periods are other than annual.

Financial institutions usually quote rates as stated **annual interest rates**, along with a compounding frequency, as opposed to quoting rates as **periodic rates** — the rate of interest earned over a single compounding period.

For example, a bank will quote a savings rate as 8%, compounded quarterly, rather than 2% per quarter. The rate of interest that investors actually realize as a result of compounding is known as the **effective annual rate (EAR)**. EAR represents the annual rate of return actually being earned *after adjustments have been made for different compounding periods*.

EAR may be determined as follows:

$$
\text{EAR} = (1 + \text{periodic rate})^m - 1
$$

where:

- $$\text{periodic rate} = \frac{\text{stated annual rate}}{m}$$
- $$m = \text{the number of compounding periods per year}$$

Obviously, the EAR for a stated rate of 8% *compounded annually* is not the same as the EAR for 8% *compounded semiannually, or quarterly*. Indeed, whenever compound interest is being used, the stated rate and the actual (effective) rate of interest are equal only when interest is compounded annually. Otherwise, the greater the compounding frequency, the greater the EAR will be in comparison to the stated rate.

The computation of EAR is necessary when comparing investments that have different compounding periods. It allows for an apples-to-apples rate comparison.

**Example: Computing EAR**

Compute EAR if the stated annual rate is $$12%$$, compounded quarterly.

Answer:
Here m = 4, so the periodic rate is $$\frac{12}{4} = 3\%$$.

Thus, $$\text{EAR} = (1 + 0.03)^4 - 1 = 1.1255 - 1 = 0.1255 = 12.55\% $$.

This solution uses the `[y^x]` key on your financial calculator.

The exact keystrokes on the TI for the above computation are `1.03` `[y^x]` `4` `[=]`.

On the HP, the strokes are `1.03` `[ENTER]` `4` `[y^x]`.

**Example: Computing EARs for a range of compounding frequencies**

Using a stated rate of 6%, compute EARs for semiannual, quarterly, monthly, and daily compounding.

Answer:
EAR with:

* semiannual compounding = (1 + 0.03)^2 - 1 = 1.06090 - 1 = 0.06090 = 6.090%
* quarterly compounding  = (1 + 0.015)^4 - 1 = 1.06136 - 1 = 0.06136 = 6.136%
* monthly compounding    = (1 + 0.005)^12 - 1 = 1.06168 - 1 = 0.06168 = 6.168%
* daily compounding      = (1 + 0.00016438)^365 - 1 = 1.06183 - 1 = 0.06183 = 6.183%

Notice here that the EAR increases as the compounding frequency increases.

The limit of shorter and shorter compounding periods is called continuous compounding. To convert an annual stated rate to the EAR with continuous compounding, we use the formula $$e^r - 1 = \text{EAR}$$.

For 6%, we have $$e^0.06 - 1 = 6.1837%$$. The keystrokes are `0.06` `[2nd]` `[e^x]` `[−]` `1` `[=]` = 0.061837.
