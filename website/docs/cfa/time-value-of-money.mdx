# Time Value Of Money

## A. Interpret interest rates as required rates of return, discount rates, or opportunity costs

Interest rates are our measure of the **time value of money**, although risk differences in financial securities lead to differences in their equilibrium interest rates. Equilibrium interest rates are the required rate of return for a particular investment, in the sense that the market rate of return is the return that investors and savers require to get them to willingly lend their funds.

Interest rates are also referred to a **discount rates** and, in fact, the terms are often used interchangeably. If an individual can borrow funds at an interest rate of 10%, then that individual should discount payments to be made in the future at that rate in order to get their equivalent value in current dollars or other currency.

Finally, we can also view interest rates as the **opportunity cost** of current consumption. If the market rate of interest on one-year securities is 5%, earning an additional 5% is the opportunity forgone when current consumption is chosen rather than saving (postponing consumption).
