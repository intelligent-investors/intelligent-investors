# Time Value Of Money

## A. Interpret interest rates as required rates of return, discount rates, or opportunity costs

Interest rates are our measure of the **time value of money**, although risk differences in financial securities lead to differences in their equilibrium interest rates. Equilibrium interest rates are the required rate of return for a particular investment, in the sense that the market rate of return is the return that investors and savers require to get them to willingly lend their funds.

Interest rates are also referred to a **discount rates** and, in fact, the terms are often used interchangeably. If an individual can borrow funds at an interest rate of 10%, then that individual should discount payments to be made in the future at that rate in order to get their equivalent value in current dollars or other currency.

Finally, we can also view interest rates as the **opportunity cost** of current consumption. If the market rate of interest on one-year securities is 5%, earning an additional 5% is the opportunity forgone when current consumption is chosen rather than saving (postponing consumption).

## B. Explain an interest rate as the sum of a real risk-free rate, expected inflation, and premiums that compensate investors for distinct types of risk.

The **real risk-free rate** of interest is a theoretical rate on a single period loan that has no expectation of inflation in it. When we speak of a real rate of return, we are referring to an investor’s increase in purchasing power (after adjusting for inflation). Since expected inflation in future periods is not zero, the rates we observe on U.S. Treasury bills (T-bills), for example, are risk-free rates but not real rates of return. T-bill rates are **nominal risk-free rates** because they contain an **inflation premium**. The approximate relation here is:

$$
\text{nominal risk-free rate} = \text{real risk-free rate} + \text{expected inflation rate}
$$


Securities may have one or more **types of risk**, and each added risk increases the required rate of return on the security. These types of risk are:

- **Default risk**. The risk that a borrower will not make the promised payments in a timely manner.
- **Liquidity risk**. The risk of receiving less than fair value for an investment if it must be sold for cash quickly.
- **Maturity risk**. As we will cover in detail in the section on debt securities, the prices of longer-term bonds are more volatile than those of shorter-term bonds. Longer maturity bonds have more maturity risk than shorter-term bonds and require a maturity risk premium.

Each of these risk factors is associated with a **risk premium** that we add to the nominal risk-free rate to adjust for greater default risk, less liquidity, and longer maturity relative to a very liquid, short-term, default risk-free rate such as that on T-bills. We can write:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{required interest rate on a security} &= \text{nominal risk-free rate} \\
  &+ \text{default risk premium} \\
  &+ \text{liquidity premium} \\
  &+ \text{maturity risk premium}
\end{align*}
$$

## C. Calculate and interpret the effective annual rate, given the stated annual interest rate and the frequency of compounding, and solve time value of money problems when compounding periods are other than annual.

Financial institutions usually quote rates as stated **annual interest rates**, along with a compounding frequency, as opposed to quoting rates as **periodic rates** — the rate of interest earned over a single compounding period.

For example, a bank will quote a savings rate as 8%, compounded quarterly, rather than 2% per quarter. The rate of interest that investors actually realize as a result of compounding is known as the **effective annual rate (EAR)**. EAR represents the annual rate of return actually being earned *after adjustments have been made for different compounding periods*.

EAR may be determined as follows:

$$
\text{EAR} = (1 + \text{periodic rate})^m - 1
$$

where:

- $$\text{periodic rate} = \frac{\text{stated annual rate}}{m}$$
- $$m = \text{the number of compounding periods per year}$$

Obviously, the EAR for a stated rate of 8% *compounded annually* is not the same as the EAR for 8% *compounded semiannually, or quarterly*. Indeed, whenever compound interest is being used, the stated rate and the actual (effective) rate of interest are equal only when interest is compounded annually. Otherwise, the greater the compounding frequency, the greater the EAR will be in comparison to the stated rate.

The computation of EAR is necessary when comparing investments that have different compounding periods. It allows for an apples-to-apples rate comparison.

**Example: Computing EAR**

Compute EAR if the stated annual rate is $$12%$$, compounded quarterly.

Answer:
Here m = 4, so the periodic rate is $$\frac{12}{4} = 3\%$$.

Thus, $$\text{EAR} = (1 + 0.03)^4 - 1 = 1.1255 - 1 = 0.1255 = 12.55\% $$.

This solution uses the `[y^x]` key on your financial calculator.

The exact keystrokes on the TI for the above computation are `1.03` `[y^x]` `4` `[=]`.

On the HP, the strokes are `1.03` `[ENTER]` `4` `[y^x]`.

**Example: Computing EARs for a range of compounding frequencies**

Using a stated rate of 6%, compute EARs for semiannual, quarterly, monthly, and daily compounding.

Answer:
EAR with:

* semiannual compounding = (1 + 0.03)^2 - 1 = 1.06090 - 1 = 0.06090 = 6.090%
* quarterly compounding  = (1 + 0.015)^4 - 1 = 1.06136 - 1 = 0.06136 = 6.136%
* monthly compounding    = (1 + 0.005)^12 - 1 = 1.06168 - 1 = 0.06168 = 6.168%
* daily compounding      = (1 + 0.00016438)^365 - 1 = 1.06183 - 1 = 0.06183 = 6.183%

Notice here that the EAR increases as the compounding frequency increases.

The limit of shorter and shorter compounding periods is called continuous compounding. To convert an annual stated rate to the EAR with continuous compounding, we use the formula $$e^r - 1 = \text{EAR}$$.

For 6%, we have $$e^{0.06} - 1 = 6.1837%$$. The keystrokes are `0.06` `[2nd]` `[e^x]` `[−]` `1` `[=]` = 0.061837.

## D. Calculate and interpret the future value (FV) and present value (PV) of a single sum of money, an ordinary annuity, an annuity due, a perpetuity (PV only), and a series of unequal cash flows.

### Future Value of a Single Sum

*Future value* is the amount to which a current deposit will grow over time when it is placed in an account paying compound interest. The FV, also called the compound value, is simply an example of compound interest at work.

The formula for the FV of a *single* cash flow is:

$$
FV = PV(1 + I/Y)^N
$$

where:

* $$PV$$ = amount of money invested today (the present value)
* $$I/Y$$ = rate of return per compounding period
* $$N$$ = total number of compounding periods

In this expression, the investment involves a single cash outflow, PV, which occurs today, at t = 0 on the timeline. The single sum FV formula will determine the value of an investment at the end of N compounding periods, given that it can earn a fully compounded rate of return, I/Y, over all of the periods.

The factor $$(1 + I/Y)^N$$ represents the compounding rate on an investment and is frequently referred to as the **future value factor**, or the **future value interest factor**, for a single cash flow at I/Y over N compounding periods. These are the values that appear in interest factor tables, which we will not be using.

**Example: FV of a single sum**

Calculate the FV of a **$300** investment at the end of **ten years** if it earns an annually compounded rate of return of **8%**.

Answer:

To solve this problem with your calculator, input the relevant data and compute FV.

$$N = 10; I/Y = 8; PV = -300; CPT → FV = 647.68$$

Professor's Note: Note the negative sign on PV. This is not necessary, but it makes the FV come out as a positive number. If you enter PV as a positive number, ignore the negative sign that appears on the FV.

This relatively simple problem could also be solved using the following equation.

$$FV = 300(1 + 0.08)^{10} = 647.68$$

On the TI calculator, enter `1.08` `[yx]` `10` `[x]` `300` `[=]`.

### Present Value of a Single Sum

The PV of a single sum is today’s value of a cash flow that is to be received at some point in the future. In other words, it is the amount of money that must be invested today, at a given rate of return over a given period of time, in order to end up with a specified FV. As previously mentioned, the process for finding the PV of a cash flow is known as *discounting* (i.e., future cash flows are “discounted” back to the present). The interest rate used in the discounting process is commonly referred to as the **discount rate** but may also be referred to as the **opportunity cost**, **required rate of return**, and **the cost of capital**. Whatever you want to call it, it represents the annual compound rate of return that can be earned on an investment.

The relationship between PV and FV can be seen by examining the FV expression stated earlier. Rewriting the FV equation in terms of PV, we get:

$$
PV = FV \times \left[ \frac{1}{(1 + I/Y)^N} \right] = \frac{FV}{(1 + I/Y)^N}
$$

Note that for a single future cash flow, PV is always less than the FV whenever the discount rate is positive.

The quantity $$1/(1 + I/Y)^N$$ in the PV equation is frequently referred to as the **present value factor**, **present value interest factor**, or **discount factor** for a single cash flow at $$I/Y$$ over $$N$$ compounding periods.

**Example: PV of a single sum**

Given a discount rate of **9%**, calculate the PV of a **$1,000** cash flow that will be received in **five years**.

Answer:

To solve this problem, input the relevant data and compute PV.

$$N = 5; I/Y = 9; FV = 1,000; CPT → PV = -649.93 \text{(ignore the sign)}$$

Professor's Note: With single sum PV problems, you can either enter FV as a positive number and ignore the negative sign on PV or enter FV as a negative number.

This relatively simple problem could also be solved using the following PV equation.

$$PV = 1,000 / (1 + 0.09)^5 = 649.93$$

On the TI, enter `1.09` `[yx]` `5` `[=]` `[1/x]` `[x]` `1,000` `[=]`.

The PV computed here implies that at a rate of 9%, an investor will be indifferent between \$1,000 in five years and \$649.93 today. Put another way, \$649.93 is the amount that must be invested today at a 9% rate of return in order to generate a cash flow of \$1,000 at the end of five years.

### Annuities

An **annuity** is a stream of *equal cash flows* that occurs at *equal intervals* over a given period. Receiving $1,000 per year at the end of each of the next eight years is an example of an annuity. There are two types of annuities: **ordinary annuities** and **annuities due**. The *ordinary annuity* is the most common type of annuity. It is characterized by cash flows that occur at the *end* of each compounding period. This is a typical cash flow pattern for many investment and business finance applications. The other type of annuity is called an *annuity due*, where payments or receipts occur at the beginning of each period (i.e., the first payment is today at t = 0).

Computing the FV or PV of an annuity with your calculator is no more difficult than it is for a single cash flow. You will know four of the five relevant variables and solve for the fifth (either PV or FV). The difference between single sum and annuity TVM problems is that instead of solving for the PV or FV of a single cash flow, we solve for the PV or FV of a stream of equal periodic cash flows, where the size of the periodic cash flow is defined by the payment (PMT) variable on your calculator.

**Example: FV of an ordinary annuity**

What is the future value of an ordinary annuity that pays $150 per year at the end of each of the next 15 years, given the investment is expected to earn a 7% rate of return?

Answer:

This problem can be solved by entering the relevant data and computing FV.

$$N = 15; I/Y = 7; PMT = -150; CPT → FV = 3,769.35$$

Implicit here is that PV = 0, clearing the TVM functions sets.

The time line for the cash flows in this problem is depicted in the figure below.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
<img src={Figure1} style={{width: 800}} />
</div>

As indicated here, the sum of the compounded values of the individual cash flows in this 15-year ordinary annuity is \$3,769.35. Note that the annuity payments themselves amounted to \$2,250 = 15 × \$150, and the balance is the interest earned at the rate of 7% per year.

To find the PV of an ordinary annuity, we use the future cash flow stream, PMT, that we used with FV annuity problems, but we discount the cash flows back to the present (time = 0) rather than compounding them forward to the terminal date of the annuity.

Here again, the PMT variable is a *single* periodic payment, *not* the total of all the payments (or deposits) in the annuity. The PVAO measures the collective PV of a stream of equal cash flows received at the end of each compounding period over a stated number of periods, N, given a specified rate of return, I/Y. The following examples illustrate how to determine the PV of an ordinary annuity using a financial calculator.

**Example: PV of an ordinary annuity**

What is the PV of an annuity that pays \$200 per year at the end of each of the next 13 years given a 6% discount rate?

Answer:

The payments occur at the end of the year, so this annuity is an ordinary annuity. To solve this problem, enter the relevant information and compute PV.

$$N = 13; I/Y = 6; PMT = -200; CPT → PV = 1,770.54$$

The \$1,770.54 computed here represents the amount of money that an investor would need to invest *today* at a 6% rate of return to generate 13 end-of-year cash flows of \$200 each.

**Example: PV of an ordinary annuity beginning later than t = 1**

What is the present value of four \$100 end-of-year payments if the first payment is to be received three years from today and the appropriate rate of return is 9%?

Answer:

The time line for this cash flow stream is shown in the following figure.

PV of an Annuity Beginning at $$t = 3$$

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
<img src={Figure2} style={{width: 800}} />
</div>

Step 1: Find the present value of the annuity as of the end of year 2 ($$PV_{2}$$).

Input the relevant data and solve for $$PV_{2}$$.

$$N = 4; I/Y = 9; PMT = -100; CPT → PV = PV_{2} = 323.97$$

Step 2: Find the present value of $PV_{2}$.

Input the relevant data and solve for $$PV_{0}$$.

$$N = 2; I/Y = 9; PMT = 0; FV = -323.97; CPT → PV = PV_{0} = 272.68$$

In this solution, the annuity was treated as an ordinary annuity. The PV was computed one period before the first payment, and we discounted $$PV_{2} =$$ \$$$323.97$$ over two years. We need to stress this important point. The PV annuity function on your calculator set in "END" mode gives you the value one period before the annuity begins. Although the annuity begins at $$t = 3$$, we discounted the result for only two periods to get the present ($$t = 0$$) value.

### Future Value of an Annuity Due

Sometimes it is necessary to find the FV of an annuity due ($$FVA_{D}$$), an annuity where the annuity payments (or deposits) occur at the beginning of each compounding period.
Fortunately, our financial calculators can be used to do this, but with one slight modification—the calculator must be set to the beginning-of-period `(BGN)` mode. To switch between the `BGN` and `END` modes on the TI, press `[2nd]` `[BGN]` `[2nd]` `[SET]`. When this is done, “BGN” will appear in the upper right corner of the display window. If the display indicates the desired mode, press `[2nd]` `[QUIT]`.
You will normally want your calculator to be in the ordinary annuity (`END`) mode, so remember to switch out of BGN mode after working annuity due problems. Note that nothing appears in the upper right corner of the display window when the TI is set to the `END` mode. It should be mentioned that while annuity due payments are made or received at the beginning of each period, the FV of an annuity due is calculated as of the end of the last period.

Another way to compute the FV of an annuity due is to calculate the FV of an ordinary annuity, and simply multiply the resulting $$FV$$ by $$[1 + \text{periodic compounding rate} (I/Y)]$$. Symbolically, this can be expressed as:

$$
\text{FVA}_{D} = \text{FVA}_{O} \times (1 + I/Y)
$$

The following examples illustrate how to compute the FV of an annuity due.

**Example: FV of an annuity due**

What is the future value of an annuity that pays \$100 per year at the beginning of each of the next three years, commencing today, if the cash flows can be invested at an annual rate of 10%? Note in the time line in the figure below that the FV is computed as of the end of the last year in the life of the annuity, year 3, even though the final payment occurs at the beginning of year 3 (end of year 2).

Answer:

To solve this problem, put your calculator in the BGN mode (`[2nd]` `[BGN]` `[2nd]` `[SET]` `[2nd]` `[QUIT]` on the **TI** or `[g]` `[BEG]` on the **HP**), then input the relevant data and compute FV:

$$N = 3, I/Y = 10, PMT = 100, CPT → FV = 364.10$$

*FV of an Annuity Due*

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
<img src={Figure3} style={{width: 400}} />
</div>

Alternatively, we could calculate the FV for an ordinary annuity and multiply it by $$1 + I/Y$$. Leaving your calculator in the `END` mode, enter the following inputs:

$$N = 3, I/Y = 10, PMT = 100, CPT → FVA_{0} = 331.00$$

$$\text{FVA}_D = \text{FVA}_O \times (1 + I/Y) = 331.00 \times 1.10 = 364.10$$

### Present Value of an Annuity Due

While less common than those for ordinary annuities, some problems may require you to find the **PV of an annuity due (PVAD)**. Using a financial calculator, this really shouldn’t be much of a problem. With an annuity due, **there is one less discounting period** since the first cash flow occurs at t = 0 and thus is already its PV. This implies that, all else equal, the PV of an annuity due will be greater than the PV of an ordinary annuity.

As you will see in the next example, there are two ways to compute the PV of an annuity due. The first is to put the calculator in the `BGN` mode and then input all the relevant variables (`PMT`, `I/Y`, and `N`) as you normally would. The second, and far easier way, is to treat the cash flow stream as an ordinary annuity over N compounding periods, and simply multiply the resulting PV by [1 + periodic compounding rate (I/Y)].

Symbolically, this can be stated as:

$$
\text{PVA}_D = \text{PVA}_O \times (1 + I/Y)
$$

The advantage of this second method is that you leave your calculator in the END mode and won’t run the risk of forgetting to reset it. Regardless of the procedure used, the computed PV is given as of the beginning of the first period, $t = 0$.

**Example: PV of an annuity due**

Given a discount rate of 10%, what is the present value of an annuity that makes $200 payments at the beginning of each of the next three years, starting today?

Answer:

First, let’s solve this problem using the calculator’s `BGN` mode. Set your calculator to the BGN mode (`[2nd]` `[BGN]` `[2nd]` `[SET]` `[2nd]` `[QUIT]` on the TI or `[g]` `[BEG]` on the HP), enter the relevant data, and compute PV.

$$N = 3; I/Y = 10; PMT = -200; CPT → \text{PVA}_D = 547.11$$

The time line for this problem is shown in the following figure.

PV of an Annuity Due

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
<img src={Figure4} style={{width: 400}} />
</div>

Alternatively, this problem can be solved by leaving your calculator in the `END` mode. First, compute the PV of an ordinary 3-year annuity. Then multiply this PV by (1 + I/Y). To use this approach, enter the relevant inputs and compute PV.

$$N = 3; I/Y = 10; PMT = -200; CPT → \text{PVA}_O = 497.37$$

$$\text{PVA}_D = \text{PVA}_O \times (1 + I/Y) = 497.37 \times 1.10 = 547.11$$

### Present Value of a Perpetuity

A **perpetuity** is a financial instrument that pays a *fixed* amount of money at set intervals over
an *infinite* period of time. In essence, a perpetuity is a perpetual annuity. Most preferred
stocks are examples of perpetuities since they promise fixed interest or dividend payments
forever. Without going into all the excruciating mathematical details, the discount factor for a
perpetuity is just one divided by the appropriate rate of return (i.e., 1/r). Given this, we can
compute the PV of a perpetuity.

$$
\text{PV}_{perpetuity} = \frac{PMT}{I/Y}
$$

The PV of a perpetuity is the fixed periodic cash flow divided by the appropriate periodic rate
of return.

As with other TVM applications, it is possible to solve for unknown variables in the
$\text{PV}_{perpetuity}$ equation. In fact, you can solve for any one of the three relevant variables, given the values for the other two.

**EXAMPLE: PV of a perpetuity**

Kodon Corporation issues preferred stock that will pay \$4.50 per year in annual dividends beginning next year and plans to follow this dividend policy forever. Given an 8% rate of return, what is the value of Kodon’s preferred stock today?

Answer:
Given that the value of the stock is the PV of all future dividends, we have:

$$
PV_{perpetuity} = \frac{4.50}{0.08} = \$56.25
$$

Thus, if an investor requires an 8% rate of return, the investor should be willing to pay \$56.25 for each share of Kodon’s preferred stock. Note that the PV of a perpetuity is its value one period before its next payment.


**EXAMPLE: PV of a deferred perpetuity**

Assume the Kodon preferred stock in the preceding examples is scheduled to pay its first dividend in four years, and is non-cumulative (i.e., does not pay any dividends for the first three years). Given an \$8% required rate of return, what is the value of Kodon’s preferred stock today?

Answer:
As in the previous example, 

$$
PV_{perpetuity} = \frac{4.50}{0.08} = \$56.25,
$$

but because the first dividend is paid at $t = 4$, this PV is the value at $t = 3$ . To get the value of the preferred stock today, we must discount this value for three periods:

$$
\frac{56.25}{(1.08)^3} = \$44.65.
$$

### Uneven Cash Flows

It is not uncommon to have applications in investments and corporate finance where it is necessary to evaluate a cash flow stream that is not equal from period to period. The time line in Figure depicts such a cash flow stream.

**Figure: Time Line for Uneven Cash Flows**

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
<img src={Figure5} style={{width: 400}} />
</div>

This three-year cash flow series is not an annuity since the cash flows are different every year. In essence, this series of uneven cash flows is nothing more than a stream of annual single sum cash flows. Thus, to find the PV or FV of this cash flow stream, all we need to do is sum the PVs or FVs of the individual cash flows.

**EXAMPLE: Computing the FV of an uneven cash flow series**

Using a rate of return of 10%, compute the future value of the three-year uneven cash flow stream described above at the end of the third year.

Answer:

The FV for the cash flow stream is determined by first computing the FV of each individual cash flow, then summing the FVs of the individual cash flows.

$$
FV_1: PV = -300; I/Y = 10; N = 2; CPT \rightarrow FV = FV_1 = 363
$$

$$
FV_2: PV = -600; I/Y = 10; N = 1; CPT \rightarrow FV = FV_2 = 660
$$

$$
FV_3: PV = -200; I/Y = 10; N = 0; CPT \rightarrow FV = FV_3 = 200
$$

$$
FV \text{ of cash flow stream} = \Sigma FV_{\text{individual}} = 1,223
$$

**EXAMPLE: Computing PV of an uneven cash flow series**

Compute the present value of this three-year uneven cash flow stream described previously using a 10% rate of return.

Answer:

This problem is solved by first computing the PV of each individual cash flow, then summing the PVs of the individual cash flows, which yields the PV of the cash flow stream. Again the signs of the cash flows are preserved.

$$
PV_1: FV = 300; I/Y = 10; N = 1; CPT \rightarrow PV = PV_1 = -272.73
$$

$$
PV_2: FV = 600; I/Y = 10; N = 2; CPT \rightarrow PV = PV_2 = -495.87
$$

$$
PV_3: FV = 200; I/Y = 10; N = 3; CPT \rightarrow PV = PV_3 = -150.26
$$

$$
PV \text{ of cash flow stream} = \sum PV_{\text{individual}} = \$918.86
$$
