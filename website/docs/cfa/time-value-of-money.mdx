# Time Value Of Money

## A. Interpret interest rates as required rates of return, discount rates, or opportunity costs

Interest rates are our measure of the **time value of money**, although risk differences in financial securities lead to differences in their equilibrium interest rates. Equilibrium interest rates are the required rate of return for a particular investment.
Interest rates are also referred to as **discount rates** and, in fact, the terms are often used interchangeably.
We can also view interest rates as the **opportunity cost** of current consumption.
