## Why Set Financial Goals?

Financial goals give you a target to aim for and help prioritize your spending and saving habits. They provide a roadmap to achieving your personal and financial aspirations, making it easier to avoid unnecessary expenses and stay focused on long-term objectives.

## Types of Financial Goals

Financial goals can be categorized into short-term, medium-term, and long-term:

- **Short-term goals** (1-2 years): These might include saving for a vacation, paying off credit card debt, or creating an emergency fund.
- **Medium-term goals** (3-10 years): Examples include saving for a down payment on a house, purchasing a new car, or investing in education.
- **Long-term goals** (10+ years): These often involve saving for retirement, paying off a mortgage, or funding your children’s education.

## How to Set Financial Goals

1. **Assess Your Financial Situation**: Start by understanding where you stand financially. Review your income, expenses, debts, and savings.

2. **Define What’s Important**: Reflect on what matters most to you and your family. This might involve financial security, buying a home, or planning for retirement.

3. **Be SMART**: Set goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

4. **Write Them Down**: Document your goals clearly and review them regularly to track your progress.

5. **Plan Your Budget**: Align your budget to support your financial goals. Prioritize spending on essentials and allocate surplus income towards your goals.
