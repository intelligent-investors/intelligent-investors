Buying a house is one of the most significant financial decisions you will make. Understanding how much you will need to pay your bank each month when borrowing money for a home is crucial for effective financial planning. This guide will walk you through the steps to calculate your monthly mortgage payment, ensuring you are well-prepared for homeownership.

## Input

- **Loan Amount:** The total amount you are borrowing from the bank.
- **Interest Rate (%):** The annual interest rate charged by the bank.
- **Loan Term (in months):** The length of time over which the loan will be repaid.

## Output

- **Total Monthly Payment:** The amount you will pay each month, including both principal and interest.

## Monthly Payment Calculation

### Monthly Principal Payment

The monthly principal payment is calculated by dividing the total loan amount by the loan term (the number of months over which the loan is repaid).

$$
\text{Principal Payment} = \frac{\text{Loan Amount}}{\text{Loan Term}}
$$

The interest payment is determined using the remaining loan balance and applying the annual interest rate, then dividing by 12 to find the monthly interest amount:

$$
\text{Interest Payment} = \left(\frac{\text{Remaining Balance} \times \text{Annual Interest Rate}}{12}\right)
$$

### Total Monthly Payment

The total monthly payment is the sum of the principal and interest payments:

$$
\text{Total Monthly Payment} = \text{Principal Payment} + \text{Interest Payment}
$$

### Example

Suppose you take a loan for $ \text{100,000,000 USD} $ with an interest rate of $8\%$ per annum and a loan term of $\text{3 years}$ ($\text{36 months}$).

#### Step 1: Calculate Monthly Principal Payment

Using the formula for the Monthly Principal Payment:

$$
\text{Principal Payment} = \frac{\text{Loan Amount}}{\text{Loan Term}} = \frac{100,000,000}{36} \approx 2,777,778 \text{ USD per month}
$$

#### Step 2: Calculate Monthly Interest Payment

For the first month, the interest payment can be calculated using the initial full loan amount:

$$
\text{Interest Payment} = \left(\frac{\text{Loan Amount} \times \text{Annual Interest Rate}}{12}\right) = \left(\frac{100,000 \times 0.08}{12}\right) \approx 666,667 \text{ USD for the first month}
$$

#### Step 3: Calculate Total Monthly Payment

Now, add the monthly principal and the interest payments for the total monthly payment for the first month:

$$
\text{Total Monthly Payment} = \text{Principal Payment} + \text{Interest Payment} = 2,777,778 + 666,667 = 3,444,444 \text{ USD for the first month}
$$
