## Monthly Payment Calculation

### Monthly Principal Payment

The monthly principal payment is calculated by dividing the total loan amount by the loan term (the number of months over which the loan is repaid).

$$
\text{Principal Payment} = \frac{\text{Loan Amount}}{\text{Loan Term}}
$$

The interest payment is determined using the remaining loan balance and applying the annual interest rate, then dividing by 12 to find the monthly interest amount:

$$
\text{Interest Payment} = \left(\frac{\text{Remaining Balance} \times \text{Annual Interest Rate}}{12}\right)
$$

### Total Monthly Payment

The total monthly payment is the sum of the principal and interest payments:

$$
\text{Total Monthly Payment} = \text{Principal Payment} + \text{Interest Payment}
$$

### Example

Suppose you take a loan for $100,000,000 with an interest rate of 8% per annum and a loan term of 36 months.

#### Step 1: Calculate Monthly Principal Payment

Using the formula for the Monthly Principal Payment:

$$
\text{Principal Payment} = \frac{\text{Loan Amount}}{\text{Loan Term}} = \frac{100,000,000}{36} \approx 2,777,778 \text{ USD per month}
$$

#### Step 2: Calculate Monthly Interest Payment

For the first month, the interest payment can be calculated using the initial full loan amount:

$$
\text{Interest Payment} = \left(\frac{\text{Loan Amount} \times \text{Annual Interest Rate}}{12}\right) = \left(\frac{100,000 \times 0.08}{12}\right) \approx 666,667 \text{ USD for the first month}
$$

#### Step 3: Calculate Total Monthly Payment

Now, add the monthly principal and the interest payments for the total monthly payment for the first month:

$$
\text{Total Monthly Payment} = \text{Principal Payment} + \text{Interest Payment} = 2,777,778 + 666,667 = 3,444,444 \text{ USD for the first month}
$$
