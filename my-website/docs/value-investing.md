# Value Investing

Value investing is a financial strategy where investors choose stocks that appear to be trading for less than their intrinsic or book value. This approach is based on the idea that the market overreacts to good and bad news, creating stock price movements that do not correspond with a company's long-term fundamentals. At the core of value investing is the concept of the margin of safety, which is the difference between a stock's market price and its perceived true value.

Prominent figures such as Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham are well-known proponents of value investing. They advocate for selecting undervalued stocks that offer potential for stable, long-term growth. However, this method is not without its challenges. Value investing demands patience, a deep understanding of financial statements, and the resilience to endure market volatility.

Investors drawn to value investing are typically those who are looking to build a portfolio of strong, undervalued stocks with the expectation that they will provide substantial returns over time. Despite the challenges, many have found value investing to be a rewarding strategy that capitalizes on market inefficiencies.
