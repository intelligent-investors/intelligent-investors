This approach is based on the idea that the market overreacts to good and bad news, creating stock price movements that do not correspond with a company\'s long-term fundamentals. At the core of value investing is the concept of the margin of safety, which is the difference between a stock\'s market price and its perceived true value.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
